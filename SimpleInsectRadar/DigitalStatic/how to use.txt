How to use (in a dialog):Add digistatic.h, digistatic.cpp, memdc.h, curvefit.h, curvefit.cpp and rgbcolor.h to your project environment. 
Add a static control to your dialog resource. 
Change its ID to something like IDC_LEDTEXT, open class-wizard and assign a member variable, type control (CStatic) to it (m_LedText for example). 
Open your dialog class's header file. Add #include "digistatic.h". Find the line CStatic m_LedText and replace the CStatic by CDigiStatic. 
In OnInitDialog() you can give it some text with SetText(), change the colors with SetColor() or for the background SetBkColor(). Or, you can set the right style with ModifyDigistyle(). 
Compile and run.
